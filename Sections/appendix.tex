\subsection{About word count and appendix}\label{About word count and appendix}
This discussion was referenced in Section~\ref{introduction}.
Hot tip - write now, worry about the word count later. After you've made your discussion as coherent and descriptive as you wanted, you can dumb it down in your document main body and move the full version to the Appendix. The Appendix does not count toward the total word count, like titles, labels, tables and captions.
